                                <li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for

                                    data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation
                                    for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
                                <li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order

                                    and therefore may only be

                                Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by
                                making an unequivocal statement in
                                any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise

                            <p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14

                                User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>

                                The European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute
                                resolutions that facilitates an out-ofcourt
                                method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from online sale and service
                                contracts.</p>
                            <p>As a result, any European Consumer can use such platform for resolving any dispute
                                stemming from contracts which have
                                been entered into online. The platform is available at the following link.</p>

                                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                                    legislations the Owner may be
                                    allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
                                    (“opt-out”), without having to rely on
                                    consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply,
                                    whenever the processing of Personal

                                <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                                    subject;</li>
                                <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                                    exercise of official authority vested in the

                                whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
                                requirement necessary to enter into
